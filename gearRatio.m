% Let R, P and S be the number of teeth on ring, planet and sun gear,
% respectively. Also, let Tr, Tc and Ts be the angular speed of ring gear,
% planet carrier and sun gear, respectively. Then, the relation between
% these gears can be expressed as follows.
%   (R+S)*Tc = R*Tr + Ts*S
% For a fixed ratio gearbox, it is practical to fix one of the gear.
% Therefore, there are 3 configuration of input and output that results in
% gear reduction. These 3 cases are compared in this script by keeping the
% # of teeth on ring gear constant. It is because the ring gear determines the
% outer diameter of the gearbox.
